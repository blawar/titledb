        "description": "The Master Trials includes the following content:\n\nTrial of the Sword\nIn the Trial of the Sword, you start with no weapons or equipment and must fight your way through 45 rooms of fierce enemies. Your only tools will be those you gather along the way. But the reward for completing such a gruelling challenge is great: finishing the trial will make the Master Sword even more powerful.\n\nHero's Path Mode\nA map update that allows you to see the path you've travelled. About 200 hours of gameplay can be tracked on the map this way. When watching your path unfold, you can adjust the replay speed to trace your past movements faster or slower. This mode may help you find shrines you've missed by showing the areas you've yet to explore.\n\nMaster Mode\nMaster Mode increases the level of all monsters. For example, red Bokoblins will become blue Bokoblins, and you'll encounter powerful new enemies that don't appear in Normal Mode. Monsters will also slowly recover health and will be able to detect you more easily. You may even see enemies and treasure chests appear in mid-air.\n\nTravel Medallion\nAn item, found in a hidden treasure chest, that allows you to register your current location as a travel gate on the map. You can only register one travel gate at a time.\n\n8 hidden items for you to find\nThe following items, which pay tribute to The Legend of Zelda series, can now be found in treasure chests scattered across Hyrule: Majora's Mask, Midna's Helmet, Tingle's Hood, Tingle's Shirt, Tingle's Tights, Phantom Helmet, Phantom Armor and Phantom Greaves. Can you follow the hints and find them all?\n\nKorok Mask\nThe Korok Mask is found in a new, hidden treasure chest. If equipped, the mask will shake to inform you when a Korok is nearby.",
